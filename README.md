## ROS Packages 

### Package: Upstart for ROS Robots
This package aims to assist with creating simple platform-specific jobs to start your robotâ€™s ROS launch files as a service when its PC/ROBOT powers up.

#### Installation
The basic usage is with the install script, which can be as simple as:
```
rosrun robot_upstart install eurobot_bringup/launch/base.launch
```

This will create a job called eurobot on your machine, which launches base.launch. It will start automatically when you next start your machine. 

### Usage
You can bring it up and down manually:

```
sudo service eurobot_bringup start
sudo service eurobot_bringup stop
sudo service eurobot_bringup restart

```
restarting service using alias
```
sudo ./restart_eurobot_service.sh 
```


### Package: Turtle Bot for driving using controls
Provides teleoperation using joysticks or keyboard.

#### Installation
* [The turtlebot stack provides all the basic drivers for running and using a TurtleBot with ROS.](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot)

#### Usage
```
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch 
```
