# EUROBOT 2020 WORKSPACE

Repository exclusively for team Brainstorm - Middlesex University of London

All rights reserved © 2020, London, UK


# GETTING STARTED

These instructions will get you a copy of the Eurobot project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See ROS Documentation section for notes on how to deploy and run the project on a Linux.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi - web](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/) - Download Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi
* [Ubuntu MATE for the Odroix XU-04 - web](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4) - Download Ubuntu MATE for Odroid XU-04



## Versioning

For the versions available, see the tags of this repository and selected branches according to your role in the team.
Keep code clean and leave comments in code or/and write brief documentation after each new feature deployed.



# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
* ROS Kinetic ONLY supports Ubuntu 16.04
* [Ubuntu MATE ISO image to download for ODROID](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4)
* Open SSH - to establish remote connection 
* GIT - for version control 
* .bashrc file must be edited beforehand in order to run ROS locally on your PC (see section 'ROS: Installation' )




# ROS DOCUMENTATION:

## Getting started with ROS [Robot Operating System]

### Installation
* [Ubuntu install of ROS Kinetic RECOMMENDED - wiki.ros tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) - Installation process in steps
* [Shell script .sh installing ROS automaticly NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS](https://github.com/chibike/shell_scripts/blob/master/install_ros_kinetic_com.sh)



### Edit bashrc in order to run ROSCORE
Environment setup
* ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched
```
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
* If you have more than one ROS distribution installed, ~/.bashrc must only source the setup.bash for the version you are currently using.

* If you just want to change the environment of your current shell, instead of the above you can type:
```
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
```

### Usage
You must have a roscore running in order for ROS nodes to communicate. It is launched using the roscore command.
```
roscore
```
* Run ROS in separate terminal and let it be running in the background
* It can be only one instance of ROS running on machine 
* To terminate or close safely roscore, in the active terminal type:
> CTRL + C

### References, knowledgebase

## ROS PACKAGES
### Usage
Provides package list and info
```
rospackage list
rospackage name_pkg info
```

Run this to provide dependecies to any script. 
<b>Minimal.launch provides basic robot functions essential to run any script in order of testing and development </b>
```
roslaunch pckg_name launch_file_name 
roslaunch eurobot_bringup minimal.launch
```

### PACKAGE Upstart for ROS Robots
This package aims to assist with creating simple platform-specific jobs to start your robot’s ROS launch files as a service when its PC/ROBOT powers up.

#### Installation
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot-upstart
```
* install YOUR launch file [within the src folder]
```
#rosrun robot_upstart install eurobot_bringup/launch/minimal.launch rosrun robot_upstart install eurobot_bringup/launch/minimal.launch --job eurobot_bringup --user root --rosdistro kinetic --logdir eurobot_bringup/logs
```
* to complete the installation 
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start eurobot
```
* to view output to terminal
```
sudo tail /var/log/upstart/eurobot.log -n 30
```


#### Usage
* The basic usage is with the install script, which can be as simple as:
```
rosrun robot_upstart install eurobot_bringup/launch/base.launch
```

This will create a job called eurobot on your machine, which launches base.launch. It will start automatically when you next start your machine. 

* You can bring it up, down and restart manually:

```
sudo service eurobot_bringup start
sudo service eurobot_bringup stop
sudo service eurobot_bringup restart

```
* restarting service using bash alias (if created)
```
sudo ./restart_eurobot_service.sh 
```


### PACKAGE Turtle Bot for driving using controls
Provides teleoperation using joysticks or keyboard.

#### Installation
* [The turtlebot stack provides all the basic drivers for running and using a TurtleBot with ROS.](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot)

#### Usage
```
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch 
```

```
rosnode list
rosnode node_name info
```

### NODE /drive_train_controller  - driving systems, braking systems, odometry
### NODE /range_sensors_ros_handler_node - ultrasonic sensors

# Electronic parts list:

# FAQ
* In case of Arduino crash - restart the service
* After creating python script make it executable with command: chmod +x script.py 
* I can't compile with catkin_make: 
** If you want to compile something you need to update the clock (time)
** You must navigate to main workspace directory while you run the command
